<h2 style="text-align:left">The Rules of Go</h2>
<!--
	1. Board Sizes (9x9, 13x13, 19x19)
		- 9x9 hyper tactical; 19x19 exhibits the beautiful balance of Tactics and Strategy.
	2. Blaze through first few moves.
	3. Cover Capturing.
	4. Scoring.
-->
<p>
	Go is played between two players, Black and White, who alternate turns and attempt to surround the most empty points (spaces): scoring one point per surrounded point at the end of the game. If a group (orthogonally contiguous monotone string of stones) has no liberties (adjacent empty points) at the end of a player's turn, it is captured by the opponent and will score one point per captured stone for him at the end of the game. There are a few additional rules which cover edge cases, but the above is the basis of the game.

<h2 style="text-align:left">Haylee vs. a 5d</h2>
<p>
The following video is by Hajin Lee, a 4p (3p at the time of the video), and features her playing versus a Tygem 5d. I will be going over some points of interest in the game while explaining the rules and some relevant terminology, but I encourage you to watch the video afterwards. If you would prefer to flip through the game yourself, the <a href="http://eidogo.com/source">Eidogo Player</a> (used in accordance with its licence: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPLv3</a>)  has been embedded below the video. Links to her channel as well as selected other useful resources can be found at the bottom of this page.
